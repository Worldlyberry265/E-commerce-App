## Fake SSL Certificate generated by openSSL package 

I created a fake SSL Certificate for mobile devices because the browser on my Iphone wouldn't allow the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() to work
unless it was https instead of http, and I'm using the navigator for the WeatherApi.

If it gave you an error, just turn airplane mode on then off to refresh your location, that will fix it

## To run the app on all platforms (desktop or mobile) and with the SSL certificate

ng serve --ssl true --ssl-key "C:\path\to\localhost.key" --ssl-cert "C:\path\to\localhost.crt" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200
Which is the below in my case:
ng serve --ssl true --ssl-key "C:\Users\Baraa Asus\Desktop\University\Submitted Work\Itxi\Itxi\Localhost SSL\localhost.key" --ssl-cert "C:\Users\Baraa Asus\Desktop\University\Submitted Work\Itxi\Itxi\Localhost SSL\localhost.crt" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200


## To compile and compress the scss files we install the following packages and npm-run-all to run them all togethor:

npm install sass npm-run-all postcss autoprefixer postcss-cli --save-dev

## Then, execute the build command to run all the sass commands:

npm run build:sass

## I went complete zoneless!

Since I'm utilising signals, I removed zoneJs and went full zoneless. However, I added the package back for the unit tests because I got error "in this configuration angular requires zone.js" and it seems I need to change all my unit tests to apply the transformation. Aa a conclusion, I added back zoneJs to the spec files, but the real angular app is completely zoneless!
